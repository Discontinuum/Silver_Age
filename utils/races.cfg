Height from 5 to 7 ft. Weight may be very different. Humans are one of most short-lived and prolific races. Their life span is from 40 to 70 years. The number of wives and childrens in the family may varies depending on the traditions of the tribe, but usually human woman gives birth to more children than elven or dwarven. Total amount of humans of the Great Continents is unknown, but significantly higher than 4 million individuals.

<header>text='Magical Abilities'</header>

Unlike elves or mermen, humans haven't connection with any magical essence, but they're still able to learn elemental magic, and many of them succeed in this case. Mysteriously, some of humans are born with talent for black magic, while others are able to become mages of light. Unlike in case of other races, humans can't choose between dark and light ways - they just have predisposition to one of them since birth. This injustice gave rise to the most ancient and massive division in humans society - feud between light and dark mages.

<header>text='Factions'</header>

The Kingdom of West and North People also known as Wesnoth - is greatest and most populous state on the Great Continent. The country's population grew throughout the Silver Age and now amounts to 2.5 million people. Wesnoth is ruled by the King, but large land holdings are owned by feudals. Wesnoth is technologically advanced country with one of strongest armies in the world. Soldiers of the Royal Army are equipped with quality weapons and armor and led by highly qualified officers. The Royal Army can also rely on the support of loyal allies - merfolk of the Great Ocean and mages of the Alduin Isle.

Despite that, there are two independent military powers in Wesnoth, which are inferior to The Royal Army, but still very influential - The Order of Paladins and the Blackwater Syndicate. While first is organization of noble knights, who fight for peace and justice, ignoring the opinions of the secular authorities, second is criminal empire of pirates and mafiosi. Both paladins and criminals are significant forces, capable to challenge the influence of the Crown.

Unlike other races, humans are very common on the Great Continent even outside their homeland. There are outlaws - black mages and criminals, who live off the beaten path beyond the borders of country, avoiding persecution. To the south of Wesnoth is country of swarthy people - their merchants sometimes visit the Kerlath. Free colonists are living to the north of the Great River. In the last century they were slaves of orces, but later Knalgan Alliance had freed them. Many of them joining Knalgan army as mercenaries. Much further to the north frozen lands are populated by tribes of northern barbarians, who eat the meat of bears and wear their skins. Another barbarian nation - people of swamps - inhabit Great River's headwaters, living in harmony with other wild races, such as saurians and froglings.

        description= _"Merfolks inhabit the Great Ocean - especially that part near the shores of the Great Continent. Legends say that the merfolks and the nagas were once a single nation and lived in the Pure Marshes in the headwaters of the Great River, but then there was a schism and a part of the people left their native waters, going down the river to the sea. It doesn’t matter whether it’s true or not, however, merfolk has no more irreconcilable enemies than nagas. The same fact makes humans the most reliable allies of the sea people - as they have the worst relations with nagas from the very first years of their arrival on the Continent.

<header>text='Physiology'</header>

On land, merfolks do not look too high, but their total length from head to tail is eight to ten feet. Merfolk can breathe air for a long time, but their health will be undermined if they wouldn't return to the depths of the sea at least occasionally. Even more than air-breathing, they are harmed by the need to move, crawling on their tails. The bodies of mermen accustomed to water pressure, so they are much stronger than human bodies, while their hands have extraordinary strength, especially when it comes to throwing objects and piercing strikes. At the same time, bodies of merfolks are subject to mysterious mutations - many are born with bodies completely covered with scales, and others without hands. Scientists of the sea people believe that their nation had exhausted its evolutionary potential and expected to degenerate (while wesnothian scientists have no idea what this phrase means).

<header>text='Magical Abilities'</header>

Magic abilities of merman are far superior to human's, especially for women. While the battle magic of merfolks may seem a bit primitive - it is limited only by what people call ''water magic'' and practically doesn’t concern other areas - mermaids-sorceresses have abilities which human mages are unable to explain. Their singing can make people - both sea and land ones - crazy and completely subordinate them to the will of the witch. Others may invoke sea monsters and command the weather. Wesnothian scientists call these abilities ''the control magic'' and try to master or at least explore it, but without any success.

<header>text='Factions'</header>

If we consider human and merman in their natural habitats, merfolks are superior to humans, both physically and mentally. It would not be surprising if the mermen had created an incredible empire, surpassing the grandeur of any human kingdom in history. And once it was so. But then the advancement of the sea people was stopped by deep-sea monsters — serpents and dragons. Merfolks tried to fight with them, but lost, and now the path to the depths of the ocean is forbidden to them. The once mighty empire has split into many kingdoms, huddled along the coast of the Great Continent and a few islands. Merfolk policy is a mystery to strangers. Anyone who intimately familiar with these proud and uncompromising creatures, should understand that they have not accepted their defeat and intend to return everything that they have lost. It is only unknown how and when they will do it.

Zombies are will-less dead dolls, created with simple spell. Those walking corpses can't even move hand or foot without order of their masters, but they may be created in a few seconds right on the battlefield.

<header>text='Ghouls'</header>

Ghouls are intelligent (if you may say so) type of zombies. Led by their insatiable hunger, they rushing into battle with unrestrained rage. Even necromancers can't keep them from devouring of everything around them, so ghouls aren't soldiers, but rather fighting animals.

<header>text='Skeletons'</header>

Skeletons are creations of more skillful necromancers. They created from corpses of former warriors. Skeletal warriors retain partial memories, so they are skilled soldiers, who don't require additional training. Skeletons are able to execute complex orders or act on a given algorithm. Necromancers had developed many types of skeletons, imbued with various sinister abilities.

<header>text='Ghosts'</header>

Ghosts are incorporeal souls of dead people, called from Shadow World. Unlike skeletons and zombies they have full memoires about their former life and able to experience complex emotions. However, ghosts are just shadows of their former selves, so they continuously suffering because of the inability to lead the old life, which makes them cruel and revengeful.

<header>text='Liches'</header>

Liches are powerful necromancers, who ascended to a higher plane of existence via ritual of dark magic. These transformation not only made them immortal, but also significantly increases their magical talent and intelligence. Their own bodies become powerful self-regenerating tool of fulfillment of their wishes. Their terrifying appearance is just a little cost for the immortality and power."

Despite being called night predators bats are blind. They prefer to hunt at night to remain unnoticed by larger birds. Vampires have amazing ability to heal itself when they drinking blood. Typical size of bat is little more than a cat, but some specimens may be much bigger. Vampires are very clever and even considered by many scientists as an intelligent species. If so, they certainly are the most short-lived of the intelligent species as their life span is about 7 years. Female bat becomes fully adult at the age of two years and gives birth to ten or fifteen whelps for her life.

To the astonishment of other races, bats are very talented in magic. They can't learn spells by themselves, but able to 'drink' magic abilities from blood of human mages.

Many people mistakenly regard ogres as relatives of orcs, however recent studies have shown that they are much closer to humans, since they have a day-type pupil. Ogres are omnivorous and dependingon what they eat their height can be from 8 to 15 feet, while their weight often exceeds a ton.

Ogres rarely have the magical ability - but this also sometimes happens. Their magic is devastating, strange and a bit stupid - like ogres themselves. In particular, ogre-magi compete with each other in spitting at range and summoning of riding elephants.

<header>text='Factions'</header>

Ogres don't have their own culture or way of life - in each region they imitate traditions of neighboring peoples. Not surprisingly, ogres from Southern Wesnoth often work as porters or even serve as mercenaries in the Royal Army, while ogres, who live in the wilderness among beasts and savages are malicious barbarians, whom devouring evetyone they can catch, including their own kindred.

        description= _"Originally orces inhabited the remote northern continent, but then have moved through portals to lands inhabited by people. Orces are a race of conquerors. They know agriculture and crafts, but prefer to take others' resourcers and values instead of produce them. More civilized nations - especially elves - treat orces as savaged and barbarians and look to completely exterminate them, while orces belive than they are destined to conquer the world once. They aren't looking to exterminate other races - opposite, they need other people to produce thing which then can be taken away by them.

<header>text='Physiology'</header>

There are two kinds of orces - baroots and kiroots. Baroots are huge and very strong - their height can reach 10 feet and their body their bodies are well suited for training. Kiroots are more like people. Both kinds of orces are compatible and most of families carry the genes of both castes. Decision on thype of child is made by elders and mistakes are not uncommon, so in the future it can be revised. Orcish women can often give birth to twins or triplets, while due to tradition of polygamy orcish man can be father of hundred or more children. This allows orcs to multiply their numbers even in the face of high mortality - while kiroot can live up to forty years and baroot - up to eighty years, most of them dying in battles even before twenty five. Despite that, orces are most numerous race of the Great Continent - their total number reach from 10 to 15 millions according to various estimates.

<header>text='Magical Abilities'</header>

Orces have wizards, but not many. Their shamanes coming in contact with the spirits - powerful otherworldly beings - and loaning their magical abilities. At the same time, amazing abilities of baroots to heal themselves and endlessly develop by training, can also be counted as magic.

<header>text='Society'</header>

Orcish traditions differs depending on the tribe. In some tribes women can own a property, while in others they are property themselves. In some tribes foreigners can be eaten alive, while others serve humans and dwarves as mercenaries. Some tribes are engaged only in robbery, while others unite in military alliances for the great conquers. However, a caste system is common to all tribes. A orc-barat is required to be a warrior, shaman or hunter - any other occupation is shameful for him. Strength and talent open any roads for barat - he can claim a position of leader or elder. Kiroot are suspended from power, but aren't bound by strict laws of honor - so many of them become marauders and assassins. The authority of the leader is limited by the council of elders. Their responsibility includes conclude the unions and announce the wars between tribes. A constant struggle for power inside and outside tribes led to the fact that most of orces die at the hands of other orces. Only when civil strife subsides, they have time to threaten other nations - but even so, orces are so numerous, than they do not give rest to anyone on the Continent.

<header>text='Factions'</header>

At present time orces divided on many tribes - only Heart Mountains have about three hundreds of them. However, many tribes have long-term alliances between themselves, which allows them to gather numerous and well-organized armies. The most influential of such alliances are: the Five Tribes Alliance (at the Far North), The Great and Vast Empire (alliance of seven tribes, inhabiting Lake Vrug neighborhood), Tirigaz and Bitok Empires (on the coast north of the Jotha Bay), and powerful tribes Nigta Maradoor and Gamarang (south-west of the Heart Mountains), which assimilated several smaller tribes. Some other empires have existed in distant times but now become mere source of easy loot for their neighbors.

If parents are goblins, they can give birth to goblin only, so number of that race rapidly growing even despite of infant - and not only infant - mortality.

<header>text='Physiology'</header>

Goblins are small and theit budies are weak. Their lifespan does not exceed thirty years. In the same time goblins have developed forelimbs and flexible bodies. Of all orces goblins most often live underground in natural or artificial caves. In mental development, goblins are not inferior to either orcs or humans.

<header>text='Magical and Technical Abilities'</header>

In very rare cases, goblins can possess real magic, but shamanism and voodoo magic are much more common. Weakness of their bodies forces goblins to survive by cunning and technology - both mystic and mechanics. Although the orces prefer the trophy weapons of the dwarves, once it can't be obtained, they turn to the goblins, and they quickly create a less qualitative, but inexpensive fake. To supply their workshops, goblins conduct their own wars, in which goals are fields and resources uninteresting for orces, like construction timber and coal. Wars for magical artifacts and spellbooks are less known, but not less rare -  despite the lack of natural talent, the goblins don't give up hope of conquering magic.

<header>text='Society'</header>

In the orc society, goblins have the least of rights, but the most of freedoms. They aren't protected by home tribe, but they can freely choose where to life and whom to serve. Doing work for the orces - whether it's building, making weapons or serving as mercenaries - goblins recieve payment. Many goblins live in separate cities - usually underground ones - under the control of their own leaders. The main military and administrative unit is the artel - a community of several dozen of goblins working together on some job. The artel is headed by the so-called ''boss''. The boss, who leads the joint work of several artels, is called ''the tsar''. Pocketing the remnants of unspent materials and the wages of those killed during the time of the mercenaries' work, many of these goblins become much richer than the orcish tribal chiefs. Despite this, internal conflicts among goblins are a rarity. Unlike orces, goblins prefer to earn wealth and respect, rather than conquer them.

        description= _"About two thousand years ago the trolls were the first race to settle the Great Continent. Presumably, they originate from one of the small islands to the west of the Pearl Bay, but which exactly - is unknown. On the Continent, the trolls chosed the mountain ranges of the Far North, and peacefully lived there, without interfering in the affairs of other races. And so it was until the orces appeared. Leader Gaturang and troll Kura Tyyk Jop made an alliance, and since then many trolls have begun to live among the orces. However, trolls are much widely spread on the Continent, so they can be found in areas where the orces were never seen.

<header>text='Physiology'</header>

Trolls are giants ranging from seven to fifteen feets, whose bodies consist of stone. The trolls have internal limbs and blood vessels, however their blood is viscous, like clay, and almost does not flow out of the wound, and the organs are the same stone as the skin. Even if the troll loses one of its limbs, it can quickly grow it again, and this also applies to the head, in which has not brain inside. Trolls are very difficult to kill, although they are vulnerable to low temperatures. Trolls prefer to live in deep and dark caves. With age, the troll loses most of the mass, and its body hardens until it turns into a immovable cliff. However, the causes of this phenomenon are unknown, and some trolls live for thousands of years without fossilizing. Measuring the maximum and average life span of trolls is not possible because of the absence of any written statistics.

<header>text='Magical Abilities'</header>

Trolls have abilities for magic and once, obviously, very well owned it. The oldest of the trolls not only can use different spells, but also able to recognize the magic of the younger races at first glance and reproduce it with stunning accuracy. However, in everyday life trolls don't use magic, and even at battle they resort to it only if they are provoked by another caster. Such spellcaster should not wait nothing good from this fight...

<header>text='Society'</header>

For the first millennium of its history, the trolls have mastered the culture and technology, and then abandoned all of this, leaving only two the most necessary things for a pleasant pastime - popcorn and stoneball. The trolls have no crafts, no army and no government. Most of them only eating and sleeping. On the other hand, the youngest individuals tend to lead a more active lifestyle - and recently they are helped by the orces. Troll, looking for adventure is a welcome guest in any orcish tribe, where he is will be fed, entertained, and told where he can fight properly. With age, trolls get tired of these primitive amusements and go back to the mountains, where they join their mature compatriots and enjoy a carefree life.

Wild boars are ferocious animals that, although aren't predators, can fiercely attack anyone who disturbs them during sleep or feeding. Orces sometimes tame them and even use as mounts, but wild boars are the main danger for hunters and not numerous travelers, as the most dangerous inhabitants of forests.

Dragones are ancient monsters, intelligent reptiles. Not all of them are huge and not all can fly, but all are proud, wise and almost infinitely powerful. They know the power, more ancient than magic and they do not hesitate to use it against insolent mortals who dare to challenge their might. A small dragon can destroy a city, a large one - an entire army, while the greatest ones can exterminate whole mankind if they'll wake up in a bad mood.

One can say from experience that a particular spirit possesses certain qualities, but other spirits may be completely different. Thus, mortals can nominally divide spirits into three categories: innocuous, dangerous and unknown.

<header>text='Innocuous'</header>

Most of the known spirits belong to this category. Although they often have enough power to harm mortals if they desire, but show no interest in them. The forest spirits whom the elves worship are mostly just like that. They accept the gifts of the elves and are sympathetic to their presence in their forests, but do nothing more.

<header>text='Dangerous'</header>

Not many, but very famous spirits are actively involved in the affairs of mortals, helping one and harming others. So, the patron spirits of the orcish tribes can be called into the battlefield by the shamans - and the enemies of the orces have to adapt to such terms. Special mention should be made of the shydes, the junior spirits, in whom high-grade elven magicians can reincarnate. All of these spirits are exceptionally dangerous for everyone they don't like. And there are also such spirits who don't like everyone.

<header>text='Unknown'</header>

Thousands of spirits are already known to mortals and even more of them remain unknown. While some simply never met with mortals, others conceal their existence intentionally - and in the second case they are ready to destroy anyone who can reveal them, be it mortal or another spirit. Such spirits are the most dangerous of all, but fortunately are rarely found.
