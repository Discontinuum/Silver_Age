    description= _ "While orcish warriors lose strength and agility with age - which is normal for most of races - shamans become only stronger. Elder shamans know the mysteries of voodoo magic, given to orcs by evil spirits. Not only their touch but even sidealong glance is deadly dangerous, which fact is well known by orces. Tribesmen always bring gold and gifts to the elder shaman, so that he doesn't curse them. This is practically the second tithing - although the orcs don't have to pay it, no one dares to refuse.

Tactical Info:

Pupil: Night type
* +5% accuracy and +1 vision range at night.
* -10% accuracy and -1 vision range at daytime.

Spells: 3 basic and 2 average
