    	description= _ "Besides battlemages for the Royal Army, Alduin Academy also train white mages for the Paladins Order. From some points it's much easier to be white mage, than red or blue - although paladins pay for education of mages, they do not force anyone to join their ranks, so after five mandatory years of healer work white mage can go on all four sides. All roads are open for him: he can become rural healer or apothecary or lord's advisor or court seer. Even if white mage lose his jobs for some a reason, there is always the Paladins Order, which always accepts him with open arms. But so great freedom is main reason why white mage should be trained thoroughly and severely, because if he get away from the right path he can become more dangerous dark mage then any other person.

From some points it's much easier to be white mage, than red or blue - although paladins pay for education of mages, they do not force anyone to join their ranks, so after five mandatory years of healer work white mage can go on all four sides. All roads are open for him: he can become rural healer or apothecary or lord's advisor or court seer. Even if white mage lose his jobs for some a reason, there is always the Paladins Order, which always accepts him with open arms. But so great freedom is main reason why white mage should be trained thoroughly and severely, because if he get away from the right path he can become more dangerous dark mage then any other person.
