    description= _ "Dragoons are light cavalry of the Royal Army. Unlike kinghts, dragoons are people of different estates and they are not recruits and not conscripted noblemen, but mercenary volunteers. The reason is dragoons serve is most dangerous - their duties include reconnaissance in force and price of their high mobility is unweighting of their armor compared with knight's, so any attack may be the last for them. Nevertheless, Royal Army have too few knights with their number decreasing every year, so Ñˆn the near future demand of drgaoons will grow and their wage will grow too.
