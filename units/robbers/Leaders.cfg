    description= _ "Henchmen are trusted servants of mercenary captain, which cover his back in battle. Although the henchman does not have a high rank, he is a truly indispensable person, as trust is a rare quality among mercenaries. And, since the voice of the previous captain is decisive in appointing the next one, the henchman has a paradoxically better chance of leading his company in future, than any of its fighters.

    description= _ "Unlike regulary army captain, whose authority rests on the military regulations, mercenary captain is more like bandit leader - he is just a chief of the company, and his subordinates don't stand in front of him at attention. But even mercenaries understand the importance of discipline on the battlefield, so the contract that they conclude when joining the company usually allows the captain to kill deserters and those, who disobey orders during the battle, on the spot. Such power is not possessed even by the king neither by pirate captains - it's not surprising that the result is the exceptional organization of mercenary companies on the battlefield.

Because not all employers need and able to hire such a horde of mercenaries, the battalion is often divided into several groups, each of which takes it's work. In this case, the captain trusts the command of these groups to his assistants, who are also called captains - it's them, whom unfortunate enemies of Dogs of War usually meet on the battlefield.

    description= _ "Agents of Assassin's Order have two degrees of mastery. The first is ''unheard'', which includes agents trained to work silently. They keep a vow of silence until they learn to hide their presence in such a way that they will be recognized as worthy of transition to the second stage - ''unseen.'' The ability of such masters to get close to the victim before it can notice is widely known, but some other skills of ''unseens'' is even more terrible. Using smoke bombs and petards, they are able to create chaos, which will allow them to pass unnoticed by the enemy with a whole detachment of agents.

Civilians of Wesnoth have the king, who wisely rules them, the army, which protects them, and warders, who guards their peace, but they still love legendary robber - a man who robs some people and gives their money to others - the most. In songs and tales people glorify the accuracy and dexterity of the legendary robber and laughts on the inability of the authorities to catch him. It is unlikely that some of these singers, having met their idol in reality, will live long enough to have time to change his mind.

    description= _ "Long ago, powerful ancient mages searched for ways to store part of their power for descendants, creating mysterious artefacts. Power of such items is well-known for people of Wesnoth - to begin with, the very country would never been created nor survived first terrible wars with orces without power of ancient Ruby of Fire. Of course, not only ancient mages were able to create artefacts - as modern magic science surpassed ancient art in many aspects, allowing mass production of items like white mages' holy relics and cursed fifes of witches. But for private individuals - even very rich - both ancient and modern artefacts aren't available. Where unsatisfied demand is, black market will always appear. Officialy, so called ''Antiquarians'' are just buying and reselling antiques. In fact, knowledgeable person can find very valuebled and powerful things among their goods. Even when truth is revealed, it maybe not very good idea to immediately grab an antiquarian - some of these people are very skilled not only in selling of magic items but also in using of them. Common city guard patrol can't handle them.
