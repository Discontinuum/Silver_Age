    description= _ "''Bloody nightmare'' isn't name of new ghosts' type, but an overview of the atrocities committed by night furies. All of these stories begin like this: ''One day group of knights caught dark mage N...'' or ''Once when necromancer N was caught by crowd of orces...''. Night furies which are usually calm and careful may become unprecedentedly cruel when their master are in mortal danger. Almost every one of ghosts possesses an instinct to protect master, but while most of them just cover necromancer with itself, furies prefer a total annihilation of all life around master. This massacre may be averted at daytime, but at night furious ghosts are invincible as they able to appear from the darkness, inflict strike and dissolve again. And when only lacerated corpses remain in the middle of the blood lake - it's what called ''bloody nightmare''.
