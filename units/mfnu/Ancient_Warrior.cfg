    description= _ "One of the main advantages of eternal life is opportunity to go to dormancy on couple of centuries, avoiding unfavourable conditions. When liches come to such decision, they also send their undead servants to conservation. When they stored at dry air, they could possibly persists for centuries. When skeletons will be needed again, they called back to life. At Wesnoth Golden Age when might of the Royal Army was incomparable and light mages have created many powerful relics for extermination of undead, many liches fell asleep along with their armies. Their burials still can be found at ancient dungeons and coffins. Modern necromancers usually equip their skeletons same way they have seen from ancient undead. Those warriors not so much hoped for invulnerability of their dead bodies and equipped heavy armor like those wesnothian heavy infantrymen have weared. Such conception wasn't particularly effective in the past, but after the invention of greatswords and heavy cavalry undead army needs heavy infantry again.
